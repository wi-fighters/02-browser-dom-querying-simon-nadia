# Menu Styling 
In the repository, there is an `index.html` starting file which has the skeleton of an online menu. Style the menu by following the instructions below. 

**Rule**: All changes to the menu should be done in JavaScript! No CSS!!

* Change the font of the body element. 
* The menu headings have a class named `category`. Use the `querySelectorAll` to select the elements by class name. Then, change the color and font-style of each element. 
* Select the warning at the end of the page by its id `warning`. Select the id without using a querySelector. Change the font-size of the warning.
* Create a function named "colorGenerator" that returns a different color at each call. Select the list items on the page. Give each list item a different color using the function that you created.
